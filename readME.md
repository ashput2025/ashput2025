### Hello, I'm Ashley Putman 
I'm an aspiring software developer! A few years after graduating, I quickly realized being a manager at a fast food restuarant was not my forte! 
I'm currently enrolled in Triple 10's Software Engineering bootcamp. If you need any help on developing a website please contact me! I'm working on improving my skills!
